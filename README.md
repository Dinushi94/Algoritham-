Linear search in C

  Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search,
  a sequential search is made over all items one by one.
  Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, 
  otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.
  
  liner search algoritham
  
   Linear Search ( Array A, Value x)

Step 1: Set i to 1

Step 2: if i > n then go to step 7

Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6

Step 4: Set i to i + 1

Step 5: Go to Step 2

Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8

Step 7: Print element not found

Step 8: Exit


Funtion using pesudcode


  int size, sk, n;
  
  int arr[n];
  
  for(n=0;n<size;n++)
  
  {
  
    printf("arr[n]==sk)
    
    {
    
    printf("Iteam is found");
    break;
    }
    
   else
   
   {
   
    printf("not the element is found");
    
    }
    
   }
